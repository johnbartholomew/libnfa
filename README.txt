### Version History

0.9  -- 6 February 2014
        First release.

### Todo

* Move the regex pattern parser into libnfa.
* Add API nfa_exec_match, implementing the core loop from nfa_match.
* Allow max stack to be overridden at compile time with a #define
  (instead of requiring an actual code change in nfa.h)
* Add some clear (supported) method of error recovery for some error conditions.
* Document recoverable vs. unrecoverable errors in the manual.
* Add support for cloning a machine, or saving and restoring machine state
* Add error checking to `nfa_print_machine`.

* Write API reference
* Write a test harness and test suite

* Do a code review / cleanup pass
* Clean up interface for capture indices somehow (track max index?)
* Determine a safe but not too loose upper bound on memory use for captures

### Done

* Make everything work when ncaptures = 0
* Expose nfa_exec_* API
* Allow a custom allocator to be specified
* Add error handling and reporting in nfa_exec_*
* Support pool and custom allocation for the NfaMachine object
* Support custom allocation for the Nfa object itself
* Write manual
* Make sure nfa_exec_start does something sensible if called during execution.
* Support case-insensitive range matches
* Merge alternated range / character matches into a single range match
* Add support for character classes in the regex parser.
